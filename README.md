# ClockworkCity
Made for the Global game jam game 2020

This game is not fantastic and remains here as an example of what too many mechanics and not enough time for polish creates.
Many of the mechanics are obscure and hard to use properly.
I don't regret it's creation but I would scope far far better next time.

If you'd like to play the game, you use the mouse to launch and recover the wrench as well as wasd to move around the stage.
